# xkcdreader

## What is it?
xkcdreader is a xkcd reader application for sailfish OS.
The original xkcd reader on sailfish is bugged, and isn't for 64-bit. The source code is missing.

## My commitment
None. I have a job, a wife and 2 little kids. I have a lot of hobbies. I just want a xkcd reader on my phone. You want something added? Make a pull request. I might add it. Maybe not. If I'm not responding, this is probably abandoned or on hiatus. Just fork this and make it your own.
